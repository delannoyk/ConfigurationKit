KDEConfigurationKit
===================

Work in progress

Ideas:
  * Changes for a specific device (include a method to identify)
  * Add caching (identify an instance of RemoteConfig)
  * Add some additional utils (nextRefreshCycle, forceCycle())
  * Add some configuration: bootstrap file, ...
  * Check if signed URL builder is pertinent
  * Encryption included in framework?
  * Check how to know if bootstrap file is last one?
